Thank you Ms Low,

For being there when we're low. 

When we consider all you've taught us, 

From 'no-arc-no-mark' to the signature 'math p.a.u', 

We want to be like you- 

Likeable, Smart, Engaging.

When we reflect all you've educated us, 

From 'being future leaders' to 'remembering taking down notes', 

We want to be like you- 

Positive, Confident, Well-informed. 

When we pore over comments from mathematics quizzes, 

From 'well done' to 'good effort', 

We want to be like you- 

Encouraging, Caring, Cheery. 

Thank you Ms Low, 

For giving us your time, energy and talent

In ensuring our brightest future. 

We want to be just like you!
